# Eggress Architecture

## Overview

Eggress is a multi-protocol TCP proxy framework built on Tokio. It supports mixed-protocol listeners (HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS4/4a, SOCKS5) with direct or chained upstream connections.

## Crate Structure

### eggress-core
Core types, traits, and infrastructure:
- `TargetAddr`, `TargetHost` — typed destination addresses preserving domain names
- `ClientIdentity` — anonymous or authenticated client identity
- `SessionContext` — per-connection metadata
- `BoxStream` — boxed async byte stream trait alias
- `TcpListener` — connection-accepting listener with semaphore limits
- `DirectConnector` — TCP connector with DNS resolution
- `relay()` — bidirectional half-close-aware data relay
- `ReplayStream` — bounded sniff buffer for protocol detection
- `ProtocolDispatcher` — ordered protocol detection and dispatch
- `ProtocolId` — typed protocol identifier enum (Http, Socks4, Socks5)
- `ChainExecutor` — multi-hop proxy chain execution

### eggress-server
Server orchestration library providing the reusable connection-handling API:
- `AcceptedSession` — typed inbound session (tunnel or HTTP forward)
- `PendingTunnel` / `PendingHttpForward` — parsed requests before route opening
- `RequestBodyKind` — explicit body framing type
- `InboundAuthentication` — listener authentication policy (none or username/password)
- `AcceptError` — accept-phase error types including authentication failure
- `serve_connection()` — main entry point: detect → accept (with timeout) → route → reply → relay
- `SessionReport` — structured connection outcome with protocol, target, route, byte counts, and failure category
- `SessionOutcome` — normalized outcomes: Completed, ClientProtocolError, AuthenticationFailed, HandshakeTimedOut, RouteFailed, RelayFailed, Cancelled
- `FailureCategory` — detailed failure diagnostics: Protocol, Authentication, HandshakeTimeout, Dns, ConnectionRefused, NetworkUnreachable, HostUnreachable, RouteTimeout, UpstreamAuthentication, RouteHop, Cancelled, Relay, Internal
- `SessionOpenError` — normalized route failure types with protocol-specific reply mapping
- `SessionMetrics` — trait for recording session metrics (latency, bytes, outcome)
- Deferred success replies — success is sent only after outbound route is established
- Common route opening — both tunnel and HTTP forward use the same `open_route()` function
- Protocol enforcement — listener configuration restricts which protocols are accepted
- Handshake timeout — configurable timeout for inbound protocol establishment

### eggress-runtime
Service supervisor and composition layer:
- `CompiledRuntimeSnapshot` — single authoritative runtime snapshot
- `compile_runtime_snapshot()` — builds shared upstream registry, router, and health plan
- `RuntimeState` — shared state with snapshot, readiness, and snapshot-based generation
- `ServiceSupervisor::run()` returns `Result<(), RuntimeError>`; bind conflicts and tokio runtime init errors are structured, not panics
- Pre-bind listeners before readiness
- Separate cancellation tokens for listeners, connections, health, admin
- Shutdown sequence: readiness false → stop listeners → drain → force-cancel → stop admin (admin stays up through drain so /-/ready, /metrics, /-/status remain queryable)
- Signal handling — SIGHUP for reload, SIGTERM/SIGINT for graceful shutdown
- Health manager integration — background health probes use each upstream's compiled `HealthConfig`
- Metrics integration — session metrics recording via `SessionMetrics` trait

### eggress-cli
CLI binary with `clap`-derived arguments:
- `-l` / `--listen` — listener URIs (multiple allowed)
- `-r` / `--remote` — upstream proxy URIs (chains with `__`)
- `--config` — TOML configuration file (runtime mode)
- `--admin` — admin endpoint for route explanation
- `upstream-test` — test upstream reachability (connect or proxy mode)
- `route-explain` — explain routing decision for a target
- Default: mixed HTTP listener on 127.0.0.1:8080

### eggress-uri
URI parser with typed AST:
- `ProxyChainSpec` → `ProxyHopSpec` → `ProtocolSpec`, `EndpointSpec`, `CredentialSpec`
- `+` separates protocols within a hop
- `__` separates proxy hops
- Redacted Display implementation for secret-safe logging

### eggress-routing
Policy-driven routing and upstream selection:
- Rule AST: `CompiledRule`, `MatchExpr` (host exact/suffix/regex, CIDR, port, source, listener, protocol, identity)
- First-match-wins rule evaluation with configurable default action
- Upstream groups with persistent scheduler instances (first-available, round-robin, random, least-connections)
- Active connection accounting with `PendingLease`/`ActiveLease`
- Health state machine with hysteresis (Unknown, Healthy, Suspect, Unhealthy, Recovering, Disabled)
- Active TCP health probes with configurable intervals and jitter

### eggress-config
TOML configuration with validation:
- Versioned schema with typed runtime model
- Recursive matcher expressions (`all`, `any_of`, `not`)
- Expanded leaf matchers (host, port range, port set, CIDR, listener, protocol, identity)
- Validation: duplicate IDs, unknown references, invalid URIs, duration parsing, regex validation, CIDR validation
- Secret sources (inline, environment variable, file)

- Reload success/failure counters
- Bounded label cardinality

### eggress-admin
Local admin HTTP server:
- `AdminSnapshotProvider` trait with `AdminSnapshot` (generation, router, pac, static_routes, listeners)
- Runtime implements the trait so admin handlers see live data from the current `CompiledRuntimeSnapshot` on every request; reloads take effect without restarting admin
- `StaticAdminSnapshot` for tests that need a fixed view
- Readiness reflects runtime state
- Health/readiness endpoints
- Status, routes, upstreams, config JSON endpoints
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- PAC generation and serving

- Route explanation supports optional `source` (SocketAddr) and `identity` (Username, 1-256 bytes) fields
- `RouteService` trait for pluggable routing backends
- `SharedRoutingService` with `ArcSwap` for atomic config reload

### eggress-protocol-http

- TCP CONNECT with encrypted address header
- UDP packet encode/decode with random nonce
- Legacy method detection (`is_legacy_method()`) producing `LegacyMethodUnsupported` errors
- SSR detection producing `SsrUnsupported` errors
- Synthetic server tests for all methods

### eggress-protocol-trojan
Trojan protocol implementation:
- SHA224 password hash authentication
- `encode_trojan_request()` — single helper that validates domain length (1-255)
  and produces the wire format (hash + CRLF + CONNECT + address + port + CRLF)
- TLS transport via shared `eggress-transport-tls` layer
- `trojan_connect()` — performs TLS handshake via the shared client connector
  and delegates request encoding to `encode_trojan_request()`
- Accepts optional `Arc<ClientConfig>` for shared config (falls back to system roots)
- Hash tests, encoder tests (domain length validation, IPv4/IPv6/domain layout),
  and synthetic TLS happy-path test that exercises `trojan_connect()` directly
  and asserts the server-observed request bytes

### eggress-transport-tls

### eggress-pproxy-compat
pproxy compatibility layer:
- `pproxy translate` — converts pproxy CLI args to TOML configuration
- `pproxy check` — validates translated configuration
- `pproxy run` — runs eggress with pproxy-style arguments (translated internally)
- URI translation from pproxy listen/remote format to eggress TOML
- Flag mapping: `-l`, `-r`, `-s`, `-v`, `-a`, `--ssl`, `-b`, `--rulefile`, `-a`, `--pac`, `--test`, `--sys`
- Default port inference for pproxy URI schemes (`default_port_for_scheme()`)
- `__` chain separator parsing

## Data Flow

```
Client → TcpListener → serve_connection()
    → accept() — protocol detection with timeout and authentication
    → RouteRequest — build from session metadata
    → Router.decide() — evaluate rules, return RouteDecision
    → Router.select() — scheduler picks upstream, returns SelectedRoute with ActiveLease
    → open_route() — direct or chain via SelectedRoute
    → send success/failure reply
    → relay() or HTTP forward exchange (with byte counting)
    → SessionReport (with rule ID, upstream group, byte counts, failure category)
```

## TLS Transport Layer

TLS is applied at two points in the data flow:

### Listener TLS (inbound)

```
TCP accept → raw TcpStream
    → if listener has TLS config: tls_accept() → TlsStream<TcpStream>
    → protocol detection on the unwrapped stream
    → route → relay
```

Configured via `[listeners.tls]` in TOML with cert/key PEM files.

### Upstream TLS (outbound)

```
ChainExecutor::execute()
    → DirectConnector.connect(first_hop) → BoxStream
    → for each hop:
        if hop.tls: TlsWrapper(stream, server_name) → BoxStream (TLS)
        handler.handshake(stream, target, creds) → BoxStream (protocol)
```

Configured via `+tls` URI suffix (e.g., `socks5+tls://proxy:1080`) or `tls = true` on the hop spec.

## UDP Data Flow

```
TCP SOCKS5 client → UDP ASSOCIATE command → server creates UdpAssociation
    → reply with UDP relay bind address (computed per listener config)
    → client sends SOCKS5 UDP datagrams to relay address
    → association decodes datagram, validates client ownership
    → route engine evaluates full route() with fallback support
    → direct: forward via direct UDP socket (one per target flow)
    → reject: drop with policy metric
    → unsupported upstream: drop (with direct fallback if configured)
    → response from target mapped back to client
    → SOCKS5 UDP response datagram sent to pinned client address
    → idle timeout or TCP control close tears down association
    → relay task removes association from registry
```

## UDP Upstream Relay

Eggress supports relaying UDP through one-hop SOCKS5 upstream proxies. The relay
works as follows:

1. Client sends SOCKS5 UDP datagram to Eggress
2. Eggress decodes the target address and payload
3. Routing selects a direct or upstream path
4. For SOCKS5 upstream paths:
   - Establishes TCP control connection to upstream
   - Performs SOCKS5 handshake (method negotiation + optional auth)
   - Sends UDP ASSOCIATE request to upstream
   - Creates per-target UDP association with upstream
   - Encodes and sends SOCKS5 UDP datagrams to upstream relay
   - Receives responses and forwards to client
5. For direct paths: sends directly via connected UDP socket

### Flow Model

Each target flow through a SOCKS5 upstream maintains:
- A TCP control connection (kept alive while flow is active)
- A UDP socket bound to 127.0.0.1:0
- An active lease held on the upstream

Flows are keyed by target address. On first packet to a target, a new upstream
association is established. Subsequent packets to the same target reuse the
existing flow until idle timeout.

### Unsupported Chains

HTTP, SOCKS4, and multi-hop chains are explicitly rejected for UDP with metrics.
No silent fallback to direct unless the routing policy selects a direct fallback.

### Reload Semantics

- Existing upstream flows keep their selected upstream until idle expiry
- New flows use the latest routing snapshot after reload
- Removed upstreams are unavailable for new flows but old flows drain

### Metrics

Upstream-specific metrics in `/metrics`:
- `eggress_udp_upstream_associations_active` - active upstream UDP associations
- `eggress_udp_upstream_packets_up_total` - packets sent upstream
- `eggress_udp_upstream_packets_down_total` - packets received upstream
- `eggress_udp_upstream_failures_total` - upstream handshake failures
- `eggress_udp_unsupported_upstream_total` - unsupported chain attempts

The `/-/udp` endpoint includes `upstream_flows_active` in its response.

### Configuration Example

```toml
[[listeners]]
name = "socks-in"
bind = "127.0.0.1:1080"
protocols = ["socks5"]

[listeners.udp]
enabled = true
bind = "127.0.0.1:0"
advertise = "127.0.0.1"
idle_timeout = "60s"
target_idle_timeout = "30s"
max_associations = 512
max_targets_per_association = 32
max_datagram_size = 65535
client_pin = true

[[upstreams]]
id = "socks-upstream"
uri = "socks5://user:pass@127.0.0.1:19080"

[[upstream_groups]]
id = "udp-egress"
scheduler = "first-available"
members = ["socks-upstream"]
fallback = "reject"

[[rules]]
id = "udp-via-socks"
upstream_group = "udp-egress"

[rules.match]
all = [
  { transport = "udp" },
  { destination_port = 53 }
]
```

### UDP association lifecycle

A UDP association is created when a SOCKS5 client issues a UDP ASSOCIATE command. The lifecycle is:

1. **Create**: `UdpAssociationRegistry::create_association()` allocates a slot and returns an `Arc<UdpAssociation>`.
2. **Relay**: `udp_relay_loop()` runs as a tracked task (`TaskTracker`), decoding client datagrams, routing through the rule engine, forwarding to targets via connected sockets, and relaying responses back.
3. **Idle timeout**: A periodic tick checks `last_activity().elapsed()`. If the association exceeds `idle_timeout` without valid client or target activity, the relay loop breaks.
4. **Close**: The relay loop closes the association, aborts all target-flow recv tasks, and removes the association from the registry via `registry.remove(id)`.
5. **Registry cleanup**: Every close path (TCP control close, idle timeout, runtime shutdown) ensures the association is removed from the registry exactly once.

Activity is updated (`touch()`) for:
- Valid client datagrams after successful client-pin validation.
- Target responses sent back to the client.

Rejected packets from wrong client addresses do not update activity.

### Target-flow model

Each unique target address within an association gets its own `UdpTargetFlow` backed by a connected UDP socket. This design:

- Simplifies response demultiplexing (replies arrive on the target-specific socket).
- Makes client address pinning straightforward.
- Bypasses the need for shared-socket peer mapping.

Target flows are bounded by `max_targets_per_association`. Idle target flows are reaped periodically via `target_idle_timeout`, freeing slots for new targets. Each flow has a dedicated recv task tracked via `JoinHandle`.

### Routing per datagram

Every UDP datagram is routed through the Phase 2 rule engine using `RouteService::route()` (full route selection, not just `decide()`). This preserves upstream-group fallback semantics:

- `SelectedRoute::Direct { selection_reason: Normal }` — forward to target via direct UDP socket.
- `SelectedRoute::Direct { selection_reason: DirectFallback }` — forward via direct, with fallback metric recorded.
- `SelectedRoute::Upstream { .. }` — forward via one-hop SOCKS5 upstream if capable; drop with `unsupported_upstream` metric for HTTP/SOCKS4/multi-hop chains.
- `RouteError::Rejected { .. }` — drop with policy metric.

Route rules can match on `transport` to distinguish UDP from TCP traffic. Route changes via SIGHUP take effect on subsequent datagrams without restarting the UDP listener.

### Supported upstream relay

Phase 4 supports one-hop SOCKS5 upstream relay for UDP. HTTP, SOCKS4, and
multi-hop chains are explicitly rejected for UDP with metrics. No silent
fallback to direct unless the routing policy selects a direct fallback.

### UDP task tracking

UDP relay tasks are spawned via `TaskTracker` (in `RuntimeState` and `RuntimeUdpService`), not bare `tokio::spawn`. During shutdown:

1. `udp_registry.close_all()` closes all associations.
2. `udp_tasks.close()` prevents new task spawns.
3. `tokio::time::timeout(grace, udp_tasks.wait())` waits for in-flight relay tasks to drain.

### Metrics bridging

UDP relay records into `eggress_udp::metrics::UdpMetrics`. The `MetricsRegistry` bridges these counters via `set_udp_metrics()`, so `/metrics` exposes live UDP counters (associations active/total, packets up/down, bytes, drops, decode errors, target flows). The bridged snapshot is refreshed on each Prometheus render.

### TOML configuration

UDP behavior is configurable per listener via `[listeners.udp]`:

```toml
[[listeners]]
name = "socks-in"
bind = "127.0.0.1:1080"
protocols = ["socks5"]

[listeners.udp]
enabled = true
bind = "127.0.0.1:0"
advertise = "127.0.0.1"
idle_timeout = "60s"
target_idle_timeout = "30s"
max_associations = 1024
max_targets_per_association = 64
max_datagram_size = 65535
client_pin = true
```

The legacy `udp_enabled = true` flag is still supported as compatibility sugar. If `udp_enabled = true` and no `[listeners.udp]` section exists, default UDP config is synthesized. If both are present and disagree, config validation rejects.

### Advertise address derivation

The SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE reply contains a computed relay address:

1. If `advertise` is configured, use it.
2. Else if UDP bind IP is not unspecified (`0.0.0.0` / `::`), use the bind IP.
3. Else if TCP peer is loopback, use the matching loopback address.
4. Otherwise, config validation requires an explicit `advertise` value.

This avoids advertising `0.0.0.0` to clients by default.

### UDP association ownership

A UDP association is owned by the TCP control connection that issued the SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE command. The association is closed when:

- The TCP control connection closes.
- The idle timeout expires.
- Runtime shutdown begins.
- Association or target-flow limits are exceeded.

Every close path removes the association from the `UdpAssociationRegistry`, ensuring `active_count()` returns to zero after the relay task completes.

### Datagram codec boundaries

The SOCKS5 UDP datagram codec is independent of socket I/O. It operates on byte slices and produces `Socks5UdpRequest` values containing a target address and payload. The codec enforces:

- RSV must be 0x0000.
- FRAG must be 0x00 (fragmentation unsupported).
- Maximum datagram size from configured limits.
- Valid ATYP values (IPv4, IPv6, domain).
- Nonzero domain length.

Encoding produces a SOCKS5 UDP response datagram with the same structure. The codec does not allocate per packet beyond the domain name representation.

### Security defaults

- Client address pinning is enabled by default. The first valid UDP packet from a client pins the association to that address; subsequent packets from different addresses are dropped.
- Multicast, broadcast, unspecified targets, and port zero are rejected by default.
- Datagram size is bounded by configuration.
- Association and target-flow counts are bounded.
- Bind to loopback by default for non-internet-facing deployments.

### Reload limitations

- UDP bind address changes require a restart.
- UDP advertise address changes require a restart if the socket bind changes.
- UDP limit changes (idle timeout, target idle timeout, max datagram size, client pin) apply only to new associations created after reload.
- Route changes apply immediately to future UDP packets.
- The legacy `udp_enabled = true` flag is retained for backward compatibility and synthesized to default UDP config when no `[listeners.udp]` section is present.

## Design Principles

1. **Separate protocol from transport** — protocols run over arbitrary streams
2. **Preserve unresolved targets** — domain names stay as domains until resolution is required
3. **Box streams at boundaries** — avoid propagating generic stream types
4. **No unsafe in core crates** — `unsafe_code = "forbid"`
5. **Credentials never logged** — redacted Display implementations
6. **Bounded everything** — sniff buffers, headers, credentials, handshake timeouts
7. **Normalized failure categories** — structured outcomes for metrics and diagnostics
8. **Configured protocol sets** — listeners accept only configured protocols
9. **Immutable routing snapshots** — atomic swap via `ArcSwap` for lock-free reads
10. **Health-aware scheduling** — upstream eligibility based on health state
11. **Lease accounting** — `PendingLease`/`ActiveLease` track in-flight connections
12. **Operator explainability** — route explanation without debug logs
13. **Shared runtime snapshot** — one set of `Arc<UpstreamRuntime>` shared by router, health, admin, metrics
14. **Graceful shutdown ordering** — drain first, cancel second; admin stays up through drain
15. **Atomic reload** — compile candidate before swap, reject unsupported changes
16. **Single generation source** — `CompiledRuntimeSnapshot.generation` is the only authoritative externally visible generation
17. **Live admin reads** — admin handlers read PAC, static content, router, and listeners from the current snapshot per request via `AdminSnapshotProvider`
18. **Fallible supervisor** — startup errors return `RuntimeError` instead of panicking
19. **Manifest-driven evidence discipline** (Phase 36) — the parity contract is encoded in `tests/compat/pproxy_manifest.toml` and mechanically validated by `eggress-testkit::manifest::validate_manifest`. The validator enforces six tier statuses (`compatible`, `supported`, `partial`, `intentional_non_parity`, `experimental`, `unsupported`), category enumeration, evidence-level semantics, test-reference hygiene (no bare file paths or CI workflow references), and platform-constraint documentation. Adding or changing a feature requires editing the manifest; CI gates on `cargo test -p eggress-testkit --lib manifest`.
20. **Release artifact separation** (Phase 36) — the parity release contract is documented in `docs/release/`: frozen targets (`PARITY_TARGET_FREEZE.md`), final report (`FINAL_PPROXY_PARITY_REPORT.md`), platform matrix (`PLATFORM_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`), migration guide (`MIGRATION_FROM_PPROXY_FINAL.md`), release notes (`RELEASE_NOTES_PARITY_RC.md`), and go/no-go (`PARITY_RELEASE_GO_NO_GO.md`). These are read-only contracts; behavior changes must be reflected here as well as in code.
